## **1. What is Face Analysis**
Face Analysis is a field of detecting human faces from a visual input, extracting feature values, and recognizing who the subjects are. It is widely utilized in areas such as ID verification, access control, and AR face filters/stickers.


## **2. Our solution**
We have built an end to end project that can detect and recognize faces in images or stream videos. Concurrently, it can detect 40 attributes on the faces.

The following flowchart shows how it works

The flowchart above shows the general structure of our architecture. We compare and test from different backbones, architectures and choose the best one.


## **3. Dataset**

In this project, we use mainly [CelebA](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset) dataset from Kaggle.com
